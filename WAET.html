<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>This document
    describes features that quality assurance and web authoring tools may incorporate to
    support the evaluation of accessibility requirements, such as those defined by the <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
        (<abbr>WCAG</abbr>) 2.0</a>. The main purpose of this document is to promote awareness
    on such features and to provide an introductory guidance for tool developers on what
    kinds of features they could provide in future implementations of their tools. This
    listing of features could also be used to help compare different types of evaluation
    tools, for example, during the procurement of such tools.</p>

<p>The features in scope
    of this document include capabilities to help specify, manage, carry out and report
    the results from web accessibility evaluations. For example, some of the described
    features relate to crawling of websites, interacting with tool users to carry out
    semi-automated evaluation, or providing evaluation results in a machine-readable
    format. This document does not describe the evaluation of web content features, which
    is addressed by <abbr>WCAG</abbr> 2.0 and its supporting documents.</p>

<p>This
    document encourages the incorporation of accessibility evaluation features in all web
    authoring and quality assurance tools, and the continued development and creation of
    different types of web accessibility evaluation tools. The document neither prescribes
    nor prioritizes any particular accessibility evaluation feature or specific type of
    evaluation tools. It describes features that can be provided by tools that support
    fully-automated, semi-automated and manual web accessibility evaluation. Following
    this document can help tool developers to meet accessibility checking requirements
    defined by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag">Authoring Tool Accessibility
        Guidelines (<abbr>ATAG</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="intro">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>Designing, developing,
    monitoring, and managing a website typically involves a variety of tasks and people
    who use different types of tools. For example, a web developer might use an integrated
    development environment (<abbr>IDE</abbr>) to create templates for a content
    management system (<abbr>CMS</abbr>), while a web content author will typically use
    the content-editing facility provided by the <abbr>CMS</abbr> to create and edit the
    web pages. Ideally all these tools provide features to support everyone involved
    throughout the process of evaluating accessibility. For example, an <abbr>IDE</abbr>
    could provide functionality to check document fragments so that the developer can test
    individual web page components during their development, and a <abbr>CMS</abbr> could
    provide functionality to customize the accessibility checks that are automatically
    carried out to help monitor the quality of the website. This document lists and
    describes the types of features that can be provided by tools to support accessibility
    evaluation in a variety of situations and contexts.</p>

<h3 id="tools">1.1 Evaluation
    Tools</h3>

<p>In the context of this document, an <strong id="evaltool_def">evaluation
    tool</strong> is a (web-based or non-web-based) software application that enables its
    users to evaluate web content according to specific quality criteria, such as web
    accessibility requirements. This includes but is not limited to the following
    (non-mutually-exclusive) types of tools:</p>
<ul>
    <li id="authoringtool_def"><strong>Web authoring tool</strong> - <cite>Any
        web-based or non-web-based application(s) that can be used by authors (alone
        or collaboratively) to create or modify web content for use by other people
        (other authors or end users)</cite>; from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#def-Authoring-Tool">Authoring
        Tool
        Accessibility Guidelines (<abbr>ATAG</abbr>) 2.0</a>;
    </li>

    <li id="qatool_def"><strong>Web quality assurance tool</strong> - Any
        (web-based or non-web-based) software application that is specifically
        designed to evaluate web content according to quality criteria (that are
        usually broader than accessibility requirements alone);
    </li>

    <li id="a11ytool_def"><strong>Web accessibility evaluation tool</strong> - Any
        (web-based or non-web-based) software application that is specifically
        designed to evaluate web content according to accessibility requirements, such
        as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag">Web Content Accessibility
            Guidelines (<abbr>WCAG</abbr>) 2.0</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these terms are not mutually exclusive. A web accessibility
    evaluation tool is a particular type of web quality assurance tool. In some cases it
    can be part of a web authoring tool, or considered to be a web authoring tool
    depending on the functionality that it provides (see the <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#def-Authoring-Tool"><abbr>ATAG</abbr> 2.0
        definition for <em>authoring tool</em></a>). Also, a web quality assurance tool might
    not check for accessibility criteria but might provide other functionality, such as
    for managing quality assurance processes and reporting evaluation results, that may be
    useful for web accessibility evaluation. This document refers to any of these tools
    collectively as evaluation tools.</p>

<p><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Web Accessibility Initiative
    (<abbr>WAI</abbr>) provides a <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/">list of web
        accessibility evaluation tools</a> that can be searched according to different
    criteria such as the features listed in this document. <span class="highlight">[<strong>Editor Note:</strong> The list of web accessibility
    evaluation is currently out of date. It is expected to be updated before the next
    publication of this document.]</span></p>

<h2 id="features">2 Features of an accessibility evaluation tool</h2>

<p class="note">[<strong>Review Note:</strong>
    Feedback on this section is particularly welcome, specifically with suggestions for
    accessibility evaluation features that are not listed below and with comments to
    refine listed accessibility evaluation features.] </p>

<p>The features of an
    accessibility evaluation tool are presented in this section from different
    perspectives: the <strong>resource to be evaluated</strong> (i.e., web content and its
    linked resources, which enable its rendering in the user agent), <strong>the testing
        requirements</strong>, the <strong>reporting customization capabilities of the
        tool</strong> and other <strong>tool usage</strong> characteristics like the
    integration into the development and editing workflow of the user.</p>

<p>The
    accessibility evaluation features listed and described below is not exhaustive. It may
    not be possible nor desired for a single tool to implement all of the listed features
    either. For example, tools that are specifically designed to assist designers in
    creating web page layouts would likely not incorporate features for evaluating the
    code of web applications. As mentioned in the abstract, the features presented in this
    section are provided as a reference. This document does not prescribe any of them to
    developers of accessibility evaluation tools. Developers can use this list to identify
    features that are relevant to their tools to plan their implementation. Also others
    interested in acquiring and using evaluation tools can use this document to learn
    about relevant features to look for.</p>

<h3 id="subjects">2.1 Retrieving and
    rendering web content</h3>

<p>This category includes features that help to retrieve
    and render different types of web content. There are tools that may retrieve the
    content to be analyzed from the file system or from a database. However, the majority
    of them do it via a network connection through the <abbr>HTTP(S)</abbr> protocol. This
    section focuses mostly on this latter scenario. </p>

<p>Due to the characteristics of
    the <abbr>HTTP(S)</abbr> protocol, the rendering of a web resource implies the
    manipulation and storage of many other components associated with it, like request and
    response headers, session information, cookies, authentication information, etc. These
    associated components are also considered in the following. </p>

<h4 id="typedoc">2.1.1 Content types</h4>

<p> Although the majority of web resources are
    <abbr>HTML</abbr> documents, there are many other types of resources that need to be
    considered when analyzing web accessibility. For example, resources like
    <abbr>CSS</abbr> stylesheets or JavaScript scripts allow the modification of markup
    documents in the user agent when they are loaded or via user interaction. Many
    accessibility tests are the result of the interpretation of those resources and are
    therefore important for an accessibility evaluation. Accessibility evaluation tools
    should state which types of formats they support.</p>

<p>Some types of content formats
    include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Markup documents</strong>. These are normally <abbr>HTML</abbr>
        [<a href="#HTML4">HTML4</a>, <a href="#HTML5">HTML5</a>] or <abbr>XML</abbr>
        documents. Processing these resources typically requires the ability to build
        a Document Object Model (<abbr>DOM</abbr>) [<a href="#DOM">DOM</a>] according
        to the different specifications, which can then be parsed and analyzed.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Style resources</strong>. These are presentation modifiers, which
        conform to the different <abbr>CSS</abbr> specifications [<a href="#CSS2">CSS2</a>, <a href="#CSS3">CSS3</a>].
        The interpretation of
        stylesheets is relevant for many accessibility techniques.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Script resources</strong>. These are components that modify the
        content, the presentation, or the behavior of web resources and web
        applications, be it because of user interaction or because of other functional
        requirements (e.g., notifications, dynamic updates, etc.). These resources
        play a critical role in Rich Internet Applications. Ignoring these resources
        may lead to missing accessibility problems or to report non-existing errors.
        The scripting language commonly used on the web is JavaScript, based upon
        ECMAScript [<a href="#ECMAScript">ECMAScript</a>] standardized by the <a
                href="http://www.ecma-international.org/">Ecma International</a> standards
        organization.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Media resources</strong>. These are images (static or animated),
        movies or audio tracks, which are standalone or embedded in a web resource.
        From the accessibility standpoint, the evaluation of these resources is
        relevant for issues like color contrast, color blindness or media
        alternatives, for instance.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Other document formats</strong>. Many reports and administrative
        information are available in other document formats, typically in government
        websites. The format most commonly found is <abbr>PDF</abbr>, initially
        developed by Adobe [<a href="#PDF">PDF</a>] and later on standardised by
        <abbr>ISO</abbr>. Although not very frequent on the web, it is possible to
        encounter as well other formats like Apache OpenOffice [<a href="#ODF">ODF</a>] or Microsoft Office [<a
                href="#OOXML">OOXML</a>].
    </li>

    <li><strong>Resources with other formats</strong>. Examples of these could be
        <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash.html">Adobe Flash</a>, <a href="http://www.java.com/">Java
            applets</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/">Microsoft Silverlight</a>, etc.
        These resources are normally found embedded within <abbr>HTML</abbr> pages as
        applications.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="encoding">2.1.2 Content encoding and content language</h4>

<p>This
    feature identifies which content languages and encodings are supported by the
    evaluation tool. The web is a multilingual and multicultural space in which
    information can be presented in different languages, thus evaluation tools should be
    in the position to address this issue. Furthermore, web content can be transmitted
    using different character encodings and sets (like ISO-8859-1, UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.),
    which demands from the evaluation tools the capacity to handle them.</p>

<p>More
    information about this topic can be found in the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
    Internationalization Activity [<a href="#W3Ci18n">W3Ci18n</a>]. </p>

<h4 id="fragments"> 2.1.3 <abbr>DOM</abbr> document fragments </h4>

<p> Many websites are generated dynamically by combining code
    templates with <abbr>HTML</abbr> snippets that are created by website editors.
    Evaluation tools may be integrated into Content Management Systems (<abbr>CMS</abbr>)
    and Integrated Development Environments (<abbr>IDE</abbr>) to test these snippets as
    developers and/or editors create them. </p>

<p> Usually this is implemented in the
    evaluation tools by creating <abbr>DOM</abbr> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html#ID-B63ED1A3">document
        fragments</a> [<a href="#DOM">DOM</a>] from these snippets. Evaluation tools may
    filter as well the accessibility tests according to their relevance to the document
    fragment. </p>

<h4 id="webapp">2.1.4 Dynamic content</h4>

<p> Web and cloud
    applications are common on the web. These applications present similar interaction
    patterns as those of desktop applications and contain dynamic content and interface
    updates. Tools that evaluate such applications should emulate and record different
    user actions (e.g., activating interface components by clicking with the mouse,
    swiping with the fingers on a touch-screen or using the keyboard) that modify the
    status of the current page or load new resources. The evaluation tool needs to define
    and record these intermediate steps that can be later on interpreted by the tool (see
    section on <a href="#webdriver">web testing APIs</a>). </p>

<h4 id="cnegotiation">2.1.5 Content negotiation</h4>

<p> Content negotiation is a
    characteristic of the <abbr>HTTP(S)</abbr> protocol that enables web servers to
    customize the representation of the requested resources according to the demands of
    the client user agent. Because of this, the identification of resources on the web by
    a Uniform Resource Identifier (<abbr>URI</abbr>) alone may not be sufficient. To
    support content negotiation, the testing tool customizes and stores the
    <abbr>HTTP</abbr> headers according to different criteria (see discussion in </p>
<ul>
    <li>to fetch a particular variant of the content, such as a mobile
        website;
    </li>

    <li>to fetch a specific language version of a website;</li>

    <li>to control session and authentication information;</li>

    <li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cookies">2.1.6 Cookies</h4>

<p> A cookie is a name-value pair that
    it is stored by the user-agent [<a href="#HTTPCOOKIES">HTTPCOOKIES</a>]. Cookies
    contain information relevant to the website that is being rendered and often include
    authentication and session information exchanged between the client and the server,
    which as seen before may be relevant for content negotiation. </p>

<p> A tool that
    supports cookies may store the cookie information provided by the server in an
    <abbr>HTTP</abbr> response and reuse it in subsequent requests. It may also allow the
    user to manually set cookie information to be used with the <abbr>HTTP</abbr>
    requests. </p>

<h4 id="authentication">2.1.7 Authentication</h4>

<p> Websites may
    require authentication (e.g., <abbr>HTTP</abbr> authentication, OpenID, etc.) to
    control access to given parts of the website or to present customized content to
    authenticated users. </p>

<p>A tool that supports authentication allows the user to
    provide their credentials beforehand, so that they are used when accessing protected
    resources, or it prompts the user to enter her credentials upon the server request.
    The tool may also support the use of different credentials for different parts of a
    web site.</p>

<h4 id="session">2.1.8 Session tracking</h4>

<p> Within
    <abbr>HTTP</abbr>, session information can be used for different purposes like, e.g.,
    implementation of security mechanisms (login information, logout a user after a long
    inactivity period) or track the interaction paths of the users. </p> Session
information can be stored in the user agent local storage, in the session ID in the
<abbr>URL</abbr> or in a <a href="#cookies">cookie</a>, for example. An evaluation
tool that supports session tracking should be able to handle these different
scenarios. <h4 id="crawling">2.1.9 Crawling</h4>

<p>Some evaluation tools incorporate
    a web crawler [<a href="#WEBCRAWLER">WEBCRAWLER</a>] able to extract hyperlinks out of
    web resources. There are many types of resources on the web that contain hyperlinks.
    The misconception that only <abbr>HTML</abbr> documents contain links may lead to
    wrong results in the evaluation process. </p>

<p>A web crawler defines an starting
    point and a set of options. The most common features of a web crawler (configuration
    capabilities) are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Types of content-types crawled (see <a href="#typedoc">section
        2.1.1</a>).
    </li>

    <li>Capability to define inclusion and exclusion filters. Tool users may
        require analysis of concrete parts of the website or may not want to include
        others. Filters can be defined in different ways. For example, the user could
        define regular expressions against which URLs are matched, the maximum number
        resources to be crawled or a maximum recursion level in the crawling
        process.
    </li>

    <li>Multithreaded crawling. For a large site, it may be important to optimize
        performance by having a tool able to crawl in parallel threads.
    </li>

    <li>Avoidance of duplicate downloads. It is typical for web resources to link
        to the same resource many times (for example, stylesheets, main navigation
        pages, images, etc.). If the crawler is not able to identify such issues, it
        may lead to a great performance loss or to other runtime problems.
    </li>

    <li>Capabilities related to features described in previous sections like:
        content negotiation, authentication support or session tracking.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="testcustom">2.2 Testing functionality</h3>

<p>This category includes
    features targeted to the configuration of the tests to be performed.</p>

<h4 id="filterTests">2.2.1 Selection of
    evaluation tests</h4>

<p>Accessibility evaluation
    tools may offer the possibility to select a given subset of evaluation tests or even a
    single one. A typical example could be performing tests to the different conformance
    levels (A, AA or AAA) of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 or selecting
    individual tests for a single technique or common failure.</p>

<p>This feature shall
    not be confused with the fact that some tools are focused on testing a single
    characteristic of the web page, like for example, a tool to test color contrast.</p>

<h4 id="manual">2.2.2 Test modes</h4>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#TestMode">Evaluation
    and Report Language 1.0</a> [<a href="#EARL10">EARL10</a>] and to the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#def-Checking">Authoring Tool Accessibility
    Guidelines 2.0</a> [<a href="#ATAG20">ATAG20</a>] specifications, there are three
    types of modes to perform accessibility tests: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Automatic - where the test was carried out automatically by the software
        tool without any human intervention.
    </li>

    <li>Manual - where the test was carried out by human evaluators. This includes
        the case where the evaluators are aided by instructions or guidance provided
        by software tools, but where the evaluators carried out the actual test
        procedure.
    </li>

    <li>Semi-Automatic - where the test was partially carried out by software
        tools, but human input or judgment was still required to decide or help decide
        the outcome of the test.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>There are some evaluation tools that support accessibility experts by
    performing semiautomatic or manual tests. This support is normally introduced by
    highlighting in the source code or in the rendered document areas which could be
    originating accessibility problems or where human intervention is needed (for
    instance, to judge the adequacy of a given alternative text to an image).</p>

<p>Tools
    may keep provenance information (i.e., which part of the report was automatically
    generated by the tool and which was manually modified). Since automatic tests only
    cover a subset of accessibility issues, full accessibility conformance can only be
    ensured by supporting developers and accessibility experts to carry out the tests in
    manual and semiautomatic mode as well.</p>

<h4 id="ownTests">2.2.3 Development of own
    tests and test extensions</h4>

<p> Developers and quality assurance engineers
    sometimes need to implement their own tests. For that purpose, some tools define an
    <abbr>API</abbr> that helps developers to create their own tests, which respond to
    internal demands within their organization. </p>

<h4 id="webdriver">2.2.4 Test
    automation</h4>

<p> When evaluating accessibility of web sites and applications, it is
    sometimes desirable to create scripts that emulate user interaction. With the growing
    complexity of web applications, there is an effort to standardize such interfaces. One
    of them is, for instance, the WebDriver <abbr>API</abbr> [<a href="#_WebDriver">WebDriver</a>]. Tools that support
    this API enable developers to
    write tests that automate the application's and the end-users' behaviour.</p>

<h3 id="reporting">2.3 Reporting and monitoring</h3>

<p>This category includes features
    related to the ability of the tool to present, store, import, export and compare the
    testing results in different ways. In this document the term report must be
    interpreted in its widest sense. It could be a set of computer screens presenting
    different tables and graphics, a set of icons superimposed on top of the content
    displayed to the user indicating different types of errors/warnings, a HTML document
    or a word processor document summarizing the evaluation results, etc.</p>

<h4 id="StdRep">2.3.1 Reporting
    languages</h4>

<p>Support for a reporting language may be
    a requirement for some users. There are cases where tool users want to filter results,
    exchange results, compare evaluation results with other tools, import/export results
    (for instance, when tool A does not test a given problem, but tool B does it), etc.
    The support for a standardized language facilitates those tasks.</p>

<p>Among the most
    usual reporting languages we could highlight the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Evaluation and Report Language (<abbr>EARL</abbr>) 1.0 [<a href="#EARL10">EARL10</a>], a vocabulary designed to
        facilitate the exchange
        of test results between Web accessibility evaluation tools in a vendor-neutral
        and platform-independent format.
    </li>

    <li>Comma-Separated Values (<abbr>CSV</abbr>) formats [<a href="#CSV">CSV</a>,
        <a href="#TABDATA">TABDATA</a>].
    </li>

    <li><abbr>JSON</abbr> [<a href="#JSON">JSON</a>].</li>

    <li><abbr>HTML</abbr> or word processor documents.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="database">2.3.2 Persistence of results</h4>

<p>The implementation of
    monitoring features requires that the tool has a persistence layer (a database, for
    example) where results could be stored and retrieved at a later stage to compare
    different evaluation rounds.</p>

<h4 id="import">2.3.3 Import/export
    functionality</h4>

<p>In many evaluation methodologies, accessibility experts and
    quality assurance engineers use different tools. If the evaluation tool supports
    import and export of test results (see <a href="#StdRep">Section 2.3.1</a>), the tool
    may be easily integrated in such environments. </p>

<h4 id="customReport">2.3.4 Report
    customization</h4>

<p>This feature allows the customization of the resulting report
    according to different criteria, such as the target audience, the type of results, the
    part of the site being analyzed, the type of content, etc. This feature may also allow
    the developer or the accessibility expert to add additional comments in the
    report.</p>

<h4 id="aggregation">2.3.5 Results aggregation</h4>

<p>The presentation of
    evaluation results is influenced by the underlying hierarchy of the accessibility
    techniques with guidelines and success criteria. Aggregation is also related to the
    structure of the page. For instance, accessibility errors may be listed for a whole
    web resource or presented for concrete components like images, videos, tables, forms,
    links, etc.</p>

<h4 id="conformance">2.3.6 Conformance</h4>

<p>Conformance statements
    are demanded by some users to quickly assess the status of their website. When issuing
    such conformance statements it is thus necessary to tackle the different types of
    accessibility techniques (i.e., common failures, sufficient techniques, etc.) and
    aggregate results as described in the previous section.</p>

<p> As described in <a href="#manual">Section 2.2.2</a>, full accessibility compliance can only be achieved
    when manual testing and/or semi-automated checking have been implemented. </p>

<h4 id="repair">2.3.7 Error repair
    guidance</h4>

<p>The majority of web developers have
    little or no knowledge about web accessibility. Together with their reporting
    capabilities, tools may provide additional information to support correction of the
    accessibility problems detected. This information may include examples, tutorials,
    screencasts, pointers to online resources, links to the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
    recommendations, etc. If the evaluation
    tool is part of an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#def-Authoring-Tool">authoring
        tool</a> as described in the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [<a href="#ATAG20">ATAG20</a>], then it
    can support the authoring tool to meet <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#sc_b321">success criterion B.3.2.1</a>.
</p>

<p>This
    feature may include, for example, a guided step-by-step wizard which guides the
    evaluator to correct the problems found. Automatic repair of accessibility problems is
    discouraged, as it may originate non-desirable side-effects.</p>

<h3 id="toolUsage">2.4 Tool usage</h3>

<p>This section includes characteristics that
    describe the integration into the development and edition workflow of the user or are
    targeted to the customization of different aspects of the tool depending on its
    audience, like for instance, user interface language, user interface functionality,
    user interface accessibility, etc.</p>

<h4 id="workflow">2.4.1 Workflow
    integration</h4>

<p>Accessibility evaluation tools present different interfaces, which
    allow their integration into the standard development workflow of the user. The
    typical ones that can be highlighted are the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Plug-ins or extensions in web browsers. Tools that integrate in web
        browsers may delegate on it the retrieval and rendering of the evaluated web
        content, effectively having as test subject the content the user is browsing
        at that moment. These tools may also present the evaluation results on the web
        browser's viewport or in a separate window.
    </li>

    <li>Plug-ins for Integrated Development Environments (<abbr>IDE</abbr>s) or
        for Content Management Systems (<abbr>CMS</abbr>). Tools that integrate with
        <abbr>IDE</abbr>s extend their typical capabilities to report accessibility
        errors. The communication possibilities range from direct integration into the
        <abbr>API</abbr> of the tool to access via a <abbr>REST</abbr> interface, for
        example.
    </li>

    <li>Stand-alone tools: desktop, mobile apps, online tools, etc.</li>

    <li>Integration into bug tracking systems, where developers and experts can
        monitor and trace accessibility problems.
    </li>

    <li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="localization">2.4.2 Localization and internationalization</h4>

<p>Localization and internationalization are important to address worldwide markets.
    Tool users may not be able to speak English and it is necessary to present the user
    interface (e.g., icons, text directionality, <abbr>UI</abbr> layout, units, etc.) and
    the reports customized to other languages and cultures. As pointed out earlier, more
    information about this topic can be found in the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
    Internationalization Activity [<a href="#W3Ci18n">W3Ci18n</a>] and in [<a href="#I18N">I18N</a>]. </p>

<p> From the
    accessibility standpoint, it is recommended to use the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/translations.html">authorized
        translations of the
        Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>. It must be considered as well that some
    accessibility tests need to be customized to other languages, like for instance, such
    as those related to readability. </p>

<h4 id="customAudience">2.4.3 Functionality
    customization to different audiences</h4>

<p>Typically, evaluation tools are targeted
    to web accessibility experts with a deep knowledge of the topic. However, there are
    also tools that allow the customization of the evaluation results or even the user
    interface functionality to other audiences like, for instance:</p>
<ul>
    <li>web developers with no or little knowledge of accessibility, who need
        detailed information on how to correct the problems found to implement
        appropriate solutions; or
    </li>

    <li>people commissioning web accessibility evaluations, who need an aggregated
        view of the evaluation results and tools to support the monitoring of their
        own websites.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The availability of such characteristics must be declared explicitly and
    presented in an adequate way to these target user groups.</p>

<h4 id="policy">2.4.4
    Policy environments</h4>

<p>Although there is an international effort to harmonize web
    accessibility standards, there are still minor differences in accessibility
    requirements in different countries. The tool should specify in its documentation
    which policy environments are supported. Most of the tools are focused on the
    implementation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [<a href="#WCAG20">WCAG20</a>], because it is the
    accessibility standard most commonly
    referenced in policies worldwide. </p>

<h4 id="toolAccess">2.4.5 Tool
    accessibility</h4>

<p>Accessibility evaluation teams may include people with
    disabilities. To that end, it is relevant that the tool itself can be used with
    different assistive technologies and it is integrated with the accessibility
    <abbr>API</abbr>s of the running operating system. In such cases, compliance with the
    Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [<a href="#ATAG20">ATAG20</a>] becomes an
    important feature to support both from the perspective of the user interface of the
    tool and the access to its results. </p>

<p>Additionally, when producing reports (for
    instance, in HTML format), it is important that they are accessible as well and in
    compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [<a href="#WCAG20">WCAG20</a>].</p>

<h2 id="profiles">3 Example profiles of evaluation
    tools</h2>

<p class="note">[<strong>Review Note:</strong> The editors and the Working
    Group will welcome suggestions on new profiles from tools to extend the listed
    examples. Furthermore, we welcome feedback on the granularity of these profiles and
    their tabular presentation below.] </p>

<p>This section presents 3 examples of
    accessibility evaluation tools. <strong>They are provided for illustration purposes
        and do not represent an existing product.</strong> In every subsection, we will
    highlight some of the key features of the tool. The table at the end of the chapter
    summarizes and complements these textual descriptions.</p>

<h3 id="plugin">3.1 Example
    Tool A: Browser plug-in evaluating a rendered HTML page</h3>

<p> Tool A is a browser
    plug-in, which can perform a quick automatic accessibility evaluation on a rendered
    <abbr>HTML</abbr> page. The main features of the tool are: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Testing of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 techniques that
        can be automatically analyzed. The configuration options of the tool are
        limited to perform one of the three conformance levels of WCAG: A, AA or
        AAA.
    </li>

    <li>Graphical presentation of accessibility issues by means of icons that
        represent different types of problems. By selecting any of the icons, the user
        receives hints on ways to solve the error.
    </li>

    <li>The tool relies on the capabilities of the browser to support cookies,
        authentication and content negotiation, but it does not offer configuration
        capabilities for these items.
    </li>

    <li>Since the tool works directly on the browser, it is not integrated in the
        workflow of users who utilize <abbr>IDE</abbr>s in their development
        process.
    </li>

    <li>The tool allows the export of the evaluation results as an
        <abbr>EARL</abbr> report or as a <abbr>CSV</abbr> file.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> presents an overview of the matching features
    as described in section 2. </p>

<h3 id="largeScale">3.2 Example Tool B: Large-scale
    accessibility evaluation tool</h3>

<p>Tool B is a large-scale accessibility evaluation
    tool used to analyze web sites with large volumes of content. The main features of the
    tool are: </p>
<ul>
    <li>It offers its users the possibility to crawl and evaluate complete
        websites. It also offers the possibility to customize which parts of the
        website are analyzed by defining or excluding different areas of the site to
        be crawled.
    </li>

    <li>Evaluation results are retained in a relational database and there is a
        dashboard to compare results at different dates. Users can select a subset of
        the crawled pages and complete the automatic and semiautomatic tests by
        inspecting the selected pages and store the results in the database.
    </li>

    <li>The tool analyzes <abbr>HTML</abbr>, <abbr>CSS</abbr> and JavaScript,
        being able to interpret it dynamically with a rendering engine.
    </li>

    <li>The tool supports authentication, sessions, cookies and content
        negotiation by customizing the <abbr>HTTP</abbr> headers and other parameters
        used in the crawling process.
    </li>

    <li>The tool performs autonomously the <abbr>WCAG</abbr> automatic tests.</li>

    <li>The reports of the tool can be exported as an <abbr>EARL</abbr> report
        (serialized as <abbr>RDF</abbr>/<abbr>XML</abbr>), as a spreadsheet and as a
        <abbr>PDF</abbr> document.
    </li>

    <li>The tool implements the corresponding interfaces to the accessibility
        <abbr>API</abbr>s of the operating system, being accessible to users with
        disabilities.
    </li>

<h3 id="mobile">3.3 Example Tool C: Accessibility
    evaluation tool for mobile applications</h3>

<p>Tool C is an accessibility evaluation
    tool for web-based mobile applications. The tool does not support native applications,
    but it provides a simulation environment based upon a virtual machine environment that
    emulates the accessibility <abbr>API</abbr> of some devices. The main features of the
    tool are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The tool can emulate different user agents running on given mobile
        operating systems. Like tool A, it relies on the capabilities of the browser
        to support cookies, authentication and content negotiation, but it does not
        offer configuration capabilities for these items.
    </li>

    <li>It shows typical display sizes corresponding to predefined smartphones and
        tablets.
    </li>

    <li>It supports <abbr>HTML</abbr>, <abbr>CSS</abbr> and JavaScript, providing
        to the users an implementation of the Web Driver <abbr>API</abbr>, supporting
        automatic and manual evaluation.
    </li>

    <li>It detects only accessibility issues related to the implementation of the
        accessibility API of the given mobile operating systems.
    </li>
</ul>
